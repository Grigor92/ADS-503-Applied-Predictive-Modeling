# Load Data
```{r}
df <- read.csv("Datasets/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv")
dim(df)
```
The dataset has 39,644 samples and 61 variables. 

# Missing Data
```{r}
na.by.col <- apply(df, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
any(na.by.col > 0)
```
None of the variables are missing any data. 

# Predictor Correlations
```{r}
library(corrplot)
df <- df[, names(df) != "url"] # drop the url column, which functions as a sample ID
y <- df$shares  # shares is the target variable 
X <- df[, names(df) != "shares"]

cor.matrix <- cor(X)
corrplot(
  cor.matrix, 
  method = "square", 
  type = "upper", 
  order = "hclust",
  tl.pos = "n"
)
```

There are some strong correlations between predictors.
